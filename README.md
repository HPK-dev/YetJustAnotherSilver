# Yet Just Another Silver

## Motivation

Our server recently started a new modded survival game based on [Create].  
We also installed [Create Craft & Addition].  
However, we encountered an issue: "Why can't I craft Electrum?"  
After checking the recipe JSON file, we discovered it requires an item `c:silver_ingot`.  
Upon further investigation, we found that many tech mods don't support `Fabric 1.20.1` yet,  
so we decided to create a new mod that adds just silver.



## Features

Add (deepslate) silver ore, raw silver ,silver ingot, silver nugget and block of silver.
